# Music Releases

Simple react web application to display album and artist list from Spotify. 

## The problem

- The main challenge was to structure the layout and divide element as reusable component. Defining props for each component was not easy to grasp. 
- We used conditional rendering based in map index parameter to bind multiple artist names by comma. 

## Design ðŸŽ¨
- We used  ES6 modules to import given icons by Technigo in .svg format as React Component, it was useful tip to know. 
- With regards to styling, we achieved hover interaction by CSS absolute/relative position and darkening the background image by adjusting opacity attributes.
